#### Bio

I'm Achilles, I build web applications. Right now I'm building [Relay](https://github.com/relaycc). Before Relay, I helped build a few different voting systems. Before that, I worked in manufacturing (_which I loved!_) and dropped out of more schools than I care to remember. I also maintain [a personal site](https://www.killthebuddha.pub). If you'd like to reach out, the best way is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/killthebuddha_).

#### Web3

Complex systems need to be in some sense _ecologically sound_ or they display degenerate behavior. Web 2.0 is not ecologically sound so we find degeneracies in the system: simplistic thinking, mobbish behavior, etc. With all its faults, the web3 ecosystem is _the first serious attempt at scale to develop ecologically sound solutions to social web applications_, so that's where you'll find me.

#### Skills

Generally speaking, I'm a _senior full-stack TypeScript developer_. I've also built production applications with Elixir and Java and have studied a bit of systems programming in C. I'm very comfortable with AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker and, more recently, have explored deploying applications to [Fly](https://fly.io). Right now I'm running a startup so I've been doing a ton of product development and technical project management. Our team's building in the open, here are some of the projects I lead:

* [xmtp-hooks](https://github.com/relaycc/xmtp-hooks)
* [Relay XMTP client](https://github.com/relaycc/xmtp) (deployed at https://xmtp.relay.cc)
* [Relay Receiver](https://github.com/relaycc/receiver)
* [Relay](https://github.com/relaycc/relay) (deployed at https://relay.cc)
