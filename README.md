# Achilles is...

a full-stack web application developer and neophyte [solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), working towards a more [convivial](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Conviviality-Ivan-Illich/dp/1842300113) society. I'm super excited about peer to peer message passing, decentralized databases, and local(ish) AI copilots.
