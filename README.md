Hi I'm Achilles! I'm a full-stack web application developer and neophyte [solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk), working towards a more [convivial](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Conviviality-Ivan-Illich/dp/1842300113) society. I'm super excited about peer to peer message passing, decentralized databases, and local(ish) AI copilots. Some things I'm working on:

- [Gadfly](https://github.com/killthebuddh4/gadfly) is an experimental programming language with the ultimate goal of enabling autopoietic copilots.
- [Banyan](https://github.com/banyan-cpu/banyan) is a programming platform for building extremely collaborative applications on the [XMTP](https://xmtp.org) messaging network. Right now it includes
  - [xmtp.banyan.sh](https://xmtp.banyan.sh) An XMTP client application focused on minimalism, productivity, and to-the-point UX.
  - [brpc](https://github.com/banyan-cpu/banyan/packages/brpc) An RPC client and server on top of XMTP.
  - [banyan lang](https://github.com/banyan-cpu/banyan/apps/banyan) A peer-to-peer programming language with `brpc` and XMTP at its core.
  - [fig](https://github.com/banyan-cpu/banyan/apps/fig) A tuplespace (distributed shared memory) implementation using [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) and XMTP.
  - [canopy](https://github.com/banyan-cpu/packages/canopy) A React SDK for XMTP and Banyan.
- [xmtp-go](https://github.com/killthebuddh4/xmtp-go) is an XMTP client library for [go](https://go.dev).
- [Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-sh/meadow) is an AI copilot for focused thought work.

I also maintain a [personal site](https://killthebuddha.pub).

The best way to contact me is either email at (first letter of my first name)(at)(my site's domain) or Twitter DMs.
