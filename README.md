#### Bio üß¨

I'm Achilles, I build web applications. Right now I'm building (and stumbling my way through CTO-ing üòÅ) [Relay](https://github.com/relay-network). Before Relay, I helped build a few different voting systems. Before that, I worked in manufacturing (_which I loved!_) and dropped out of more schools than I care to remember. I also maintain [a personal site](https://www.killthebuddha.pub). If you'd like to reach out, the best way is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/killthebuddha_).

#### Core Technical Skills üõ†

Generally speaking, I can do whatever it takes to lead a project from idea to production. More specifically, I'm a full-stack application developer with a strong understanding of ops and infrastructure. I specialize in TypeScript but also have experience with Elixir, Python, and Java. I've been working in the web3 ecosystem for the last few years and the language model ecosystem for the last year.

#### Web3 üöÄ

To me, web3 is not about money but about _identity_, user-friendly public key cryptography, and open source software. Complex systems need to be in some sense _ecologically sound_ or they get sick and display degenerate behavior. Web 2.0 is not ecologically sound, it's a bunch of disjoint monocultures slapped together, so we find degeneracies in the system: simplistic thinking, mobbish behavior, runaway (thought) processes, etc. Web3 defined as "networked applications powered by decentralized identity and open/self-sovereign data" is in my opinion _the most promising attempt at scale to develop ecologically sound solutions to social web applications_; it will be an important part of the solution to the information plagues running through the world's media platforms and, by extension, its people.
