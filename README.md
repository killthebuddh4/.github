#### Bio

I'm Achilles, a web developer. Right now I'm building [Relay](https://github.com/relaycc). Before Relay, I helped build a few different voting systems. Before that, I worked in manufacturing (_which I loved!_) and dropped out of more schools than I care to remember. I also maintain a personal site at https://www.killthebuddha.pub. If you'd like to reach out, the best way is probably [Twitter](https://twitter.com/killthebuddha_).

#### Web3
I _fucking despise_ how the web-2.0 ads-centric business model has affected western liberalism. Even if the web-2.0 behemoths had been able to remain not-evil, there's something eminently inelegant about the siloed-index approach to building a software business. With all its faults, the web3 ecosystem is _the first serious attempt_ to find a better way, so that's where you'll find me for the near future.

#### Skills

Generally speaking, I'm a _senior full-stack TypeScript developer_. I've also built production applications with Elixir and Java and have explored a bit of systems programming in C. I'm very comfortable with AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker and, more recently, have explored deploying applications to [Fly](https://fly.io). If you'd like to learn more about my skillset, the best way is probably to use the GitHub search tool or to dive into some of the projects I lead:

* [Relay Receiver](https://github.com/relaycc/receiver)
